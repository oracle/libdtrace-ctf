# Linux libdtrace-ctf

libdtrace-ctf is a port of the Solaris Compact Type Format library to Linux.
It's meant to be used with DTrace for Linux.
Its file format is similar to but not compatible with Solaris CTF files.
The public API is source-compatible, to ease adoption of Linux for libctf users.

The source has been available at
[oss.oracle.com](https://oss.oracle.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libdtrace-ctf.git;a=tags),
as a git repository with full git history.
By posting the source here on github.com, we hope to increase the visibility for our work
and to make it even easier for people to access the source.
We will also use this repository to work with developers in the Linux community.

See the [dtrace-utils README](https://github.com/oracle/dtrace-utils)
for more information on how to build DTrace utilities
with `libdtrace-ctf` for the Linux kernel.
