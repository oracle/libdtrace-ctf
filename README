libdtrace-ctf is a port of the Solaris Compact Type Format library to Linux.
Its file format is similar to but not compatible with Solaris CTF files, but
its public API is source-compatible, to ease porting of libctf users to
Linux.

It's meant for the use of DTrace for Linux, but is dual-licensed under the GPL
in order that it may be used in the Linux kernel build process, and potentially
in any other projects that may find it useful.
